# sntp-web-display
Web display of a comparison of web server time to NTP time

This is PHP that fetches NTP time.  It then gives a detailed HTML display of 
the time versus the web server's time--that is, the server running this code.

This code does not modify the clock.  

Under the doc folder are more detailed ReadMe docs.
