This code compares the clock of the machine running this server-side code to NTP servers including the "official" US time kept by NIST servers.  It gives 
detailed HTML displays of the comparisons.  This code does not try to set / adjust the clock.

I started this because I couldn't find a simple answer to the question of how to get time from the time servers.  Then I found a fairly simple 
solution and started whittling on it.  Then I kept whittling on it.  Then I got obsessed with being able to check my clock.  

ReadMe2.txt is more technical.  The rest of this is probably mostly my musings.

I'm starting this file on 2020/01/20 around 6:30pm EST (GMT / UTC -5).  I am Kwynn Buess or kwynn.com.  

As I write this I will soon write this code to GitHub.  

I posted my first true contribution to GitHub around 2 hours ago.  It also involved checking time.  The other project is checking the end user's 
time rather than the server's time: https://github.com/kwynncom/javascript-synchronized-clock

So now I'm trying to stay on a roll and start adding stuff to GitHub.  I have roughly another 8 projects I would like to eventually post.

This project isn't as refined as the first one.  I'm trying to go with the notion that less polished code contributed to the community is better than none.  
Self-consciousness has slowed me down from GitHub for longer than I care to admit.  Also, I'd sent this to some apprentices, so it's had a very little 
bit of review aleady.  Having already released it to someone makes this easier, as does "pushing" the JS clock.

With the JS code, I went through and changed quite a few variable names and commented much of the code and such, before posting it.  This time, again, 
I'm just trying to post.  I hope that someone will get something out of working code.
